2. Whenever we write "services," "projects," we're referring open source software built by Drabkirn.

3. Whenever we write "you" (or "your" or "users"), we're referring to you(contributor who submits a contribution to us OR party signing below).

4. "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, submitted by you to us, in which you own the copyright.

5. "Copyright" means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral, and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence.

6. "Project" means any of the projects owned or managed by Drabkirn in which software is offered under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) ([https://www.opensource.org](https://www.opensource.org/ "visit opensource website")) and/or documentation provided under an OSI or a Creative Commons license ([https://creativecommons.org/licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses "visit creative commons website")).

"Submit" is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the project to discuss and improve that project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution."

You must accept and agree to the following Agreement for your past, present, and future contributions to Drabkirn open source projects by signing this Agreement.

### Originality of work
You represent that each of your contributions is entirely your original work. Should you wish to submit materials(or code) that are not your original work, you may submit them separately to the project if you:
1. Retain all the copyright and license information that was in the materials as you received them,

2. In the description accompanying your contribution, include the phrase "Contribution containing materials of a third party:" followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other restrictions of which you are aware of, and

3. Follow any additional instructions in the project's written guidelines concerning contributions.

If your contribution is made as a part of your employment with past or present employer(s), you represent that such employer(s) has authorized you to make your contributions on behalf of such employer(s). In this case, the term "you" in this Agreement will refer to you and the employer(s) collectively. OR it would be best if you made sure such that your employer(s) has waived all of their right, title, or interest in or to your contributions. If you change employers in the future and desire to submit additional contributions for the new employer, then you agree to sign a new Agreement and secure permission from the new employer before submitting those contributions.
